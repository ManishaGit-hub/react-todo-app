**Learning Note**
This app was first built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to practice DOM manipulation and core JavaScript concepts.
It was then re-implemented in React to learn about component-based design, props, state management, and deployment.
This comparison helped me clearly see the differences between building apps in plain JS vs React.
